1) 	.L ConvertTxtToRoot.c+
	ConvertTxtToRoot("FILE_NAME.txt")

FILE_NAME.txt is the name of the file containing the signal coordinates (only the y-axis (Tension) values are written, the corresponding x-axis (Time) valuse are evaluated knowing the number of divisions for the time scale). This is done for the signal of each channel and each detected event.

The macro converts the txt file into a root readable file with the same name, but with the .root extension

2)	.L ProcessFile.c+
	ProcessFile("FILE_NAME.root")

FILE_NAME.root is the name of the file converted by "ConvertTxtToRoot()"

The macro converts the root file into TTrees named "FILE_NAME_TTree.root"	

3)	.L StabilityCheckFromTree.c+
	StabilityCheckFromTree("FILE_NAME_TTree.root", TRIGGER_CHANNEL)

TRIGGER_CHANNEL is the channel (1, 2, 3 or 4) on which we are triggering. They correspond to the different pixel connected.
In the current setup: Ch1 <-> J5; Ch2 <-> J6; Ch3 <-> J10; Ch4 <-> J9

Plots the values of Amplitude, Falltime and Baseline for each single event and the time between events.

4) 	.L PlotFromTree.c+
	PlotFromTree()

The macro uses an additional txt file ("configuration.txt") to know what files to analize. The sintax of the config file is:

line1:	number_of_analyzed_files(max 5)		Triggered_channel(J5, J6; J9 or J10)	
line2:	FILE_NAME_TTree.root;	Triggered_channel;	Color(number between 1 and 10);		APTS##-J##
line3:	SAME AS LINE 2 BUT FOR FURTHER ANALYZED FILES

LineN:	SAME AS LINE 2 BUT FOR FURTHER ANALYZED FILES

e.g. ("configuration.txt")
